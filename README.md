# E-Commerce API Demo (Ruby on Rails)

This is a demo project created to compare the development experience of using various different editors/IDEs with AI features.

This project implements a RESTful API for an e-commerce application, built with Ruby on Rails. The implementation uses PostgreSQL for database storage and follows REST principles for resource management.

## Features

- Complete CRUD operations for Customers, Shop Item Categories, Shop Items, and Orders
- Data validations with descriptive error messages
- RESTful API endpoints returning JSON responses
- Comprehensive test suite for all endpoints
- Docker support for easy deployment

## System Requirements

* Ruby 3.2.8 or higher
* Rails 8.0.2 or higher
* PostgreSQL 12 or higher

## Getting Started

### Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone [repository URL]
   cd [repository name]
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   bundle install
   ```

3. Database setup:
   
   Ensure PostgreSQL is running on your system. Then create and set up the database:
   ```
   bin/rails db:create
   bin/rails db:migrate
   ```

4. Seed the database with sample data:
   ```
   bin/rails db:seed
   ```

5. Running the server:
   ```
   bin/rails server
   ```
   The API will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Running Tests

Run the test suite to ensure everything is working correctly:
```
bin/rails test
```

Run RuboCop to check code style:
```
bundle exec rubocop
```
